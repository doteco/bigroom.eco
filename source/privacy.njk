		<h1>Big Room Inc. Privacy Policy</h1>
		<i>Updated: March 16, 2017</i>
		<h2>Objective and Scope of Policy</h2>
		<p>
			Big Room Inc. (“Big Room”) is committed to protecting your privacy. The following policy describes how we collect, store, use and distribute information about bigroom.eco website users.
		</p>
		<p>Our goal is to collect, use and disclose only that information reasonably required to enable us to provide the particular product or service that you have requested, to maintain our customer/visitor lists and/or to respond to your inquiries or feedback. If you have provided us with contact information, we will maintain the confidentiality of your contact information and use it only for the purposes for which we have collected it, unless you agree that we may disclose it to other third parties (subject to the exclusions we have listed below).</p>

		<h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
		<p>By using Big Room’s bigroom.eco website, you consent to the collection and use by Big Room of Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

		<h2>Collection of Information</h2>
		<p>Two types of information may be collected on the bigroom.eco website: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information.</p>
		<p>“Personal Information” is personally identifiable information, such as your name or e-mail address. At the time of collection we will set out clearly the information that we are collecting and the purposes for which we will use it. It is always your choice whether or not to provide Personal Information. If you choose not to provide requested Personal Information, you may not be able to use certain features of the website and you will not be able to engage in transactions through the website. The following is a list of the means by which Big Room may collect Personal Information on this website:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Communications from you (e.g. e-mails, blog comments);</li>
			<li>Information downloads (e.g. newsletters); and </li>
			<li>Surveys</li>
		</ul>

		<p>“Non-Personal Information” is information of an anonymous nature, such as an Internet Protocol Address (IP Address), the domain used to access the bigroom.eco website, and the type and version of browser or operating system being used. Aggregate information, such as demographic statistics of our users (e.g. average age or geographical allocation of our users), number of visitors, what pages users access or visit, average time spent on this website, and information volunteered by the user, such as survey information, is also considered Non-Personal Information. Business contact information such as the name, title, business address or telephone number of a business or professional person or an employee of an organization is not considered Personal Information.</p>
		<p>Non-Personal Information is collected or derived by us in the course of operating this website. For example, our web servers may automatically collect Non-Personal Information which is provided through your browser or stored on a Cookie when you choose to visit the bigroom.eco website.</p>
		<p>“Cookies” are used by Big Room to track content usage and traffic on this website. A cookie is a feature of your web browser that consists of a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a webpage server. Big Room uses cookies to help it compile aggregate statistics about usage of this website, such as how many users visit the website, how long users spend viewing the website, and what pages are viewed most often. This information is used to improve the content of the website. You can set your browser to notify you when you are sent a cookie. This gives you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. If you disable cookies however, you may not be able to take advantage of all the features of this website.</p>

		<h2>Use of Information</h2>
		<p>Big Room collects information only for the following purposes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>To contact and correspond with you;</li>
			<li>To deliver newsletters and updates you subscribed to receive;</li>
			<li>To facilitate and enhance your use of the website;</li>
			<li>To meet legal and regulatory requirements; and</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Your Personal Information will not be used for any other purpose without your consent. Please be assured that we will not actively collect personally identifiable user information for the purpose of sale or marketing in a way that specifically identifies the individual. In other words, we don’t sell customer lists.</p>

		<h2>Important Exceptions</h2>
		<p>We may disclose your Personal Information to a third party without your consent if we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other website users or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may disclose Personal Information when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is required by and in accordance with the law.</p>
		<p>We may also disclose your Personal Information in connection with a corporate re-organization, a merger or amalgamation with another entity, or a sale of all or a substantial portion of our assets provided that the information disclosed continues to be used for the purposes permitted by this Privacy Policy by the entity acquiring the information.</p>

		<h2>Outside Parties and Sites</h2>
		<p>Through Big Room’s website, you may be introduced to a variety of third party vendors and websites. The privacy policies of these third parties are not under our control and may differ from ours. The use of any information that you may provide to any third party, or the use of “cookie” technology by any third party, will be governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the website that you are visiting. If you have any doubts about the privacy of the information you are providing on another website, we recommend that you contact that website directly for more information and review its privacy policy.</p>

		<h2>Security</h2>

Big Room takes technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security steps to protect Personal Information that you provide to us. We have implemented procedures to ensure that your Personal Information is only made available to such designated staff as necessary to carry out the stated purposes that we have communicated to you.</p>

		<h2>Retention</h2>
		<p>Big Room will keep your Personal Information for as long as it remains necessary for the identified purpose or as required by law, which may extend beyond the termination of our relationship with you.</p>
		<p>If you request that your name be removed from our databases, it may not be possible to completely delete all your Personal Information due to technological and legal constraints.</p>
